intergers  are whole numbers with out decimal ponit in the  = 10
number with decimal are flots e.g 4.9
we are learning about veriables, where we can get veriable by coding 
print = 10 
print(price) 
and that will print 10.

when adding more then one word as veriable alway us _ e,g is_published 

price = 10
rating = 4.9
name = "dan"
is_published = True
print(price)

 in part 2 
ask asking to right 2 veriable, patients name, age, and if the patinet is new.

name = "John smith"
age = 20 
is_new = True
this is my work.


we have now started to learn input, input is put in to coding when you want to add question  or in put data to save on to the program
name = input("what is your name? ")
print("Hi " + name)

this program print ask for your name and will print saying hi and the name you have type in.]

now have been asking to creat program person name and favourite color
this was my color 
name = input("what is your name? ")
color = input("what is your favourite color? ")
print(name + " likes " + color)
